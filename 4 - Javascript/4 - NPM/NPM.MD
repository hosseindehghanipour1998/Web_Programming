# What is NPM ?
  - NPM was created for developers to share _JS_ code with each other.
  - NPM provides Packages for _JS_ ( AKA Modularity for other Programming Languages).
  - Each package includes a ***Package.Json*** file that includes meta-data for the JS packages.
  - Packages allow us to _"save time"_ by not writing everything from scratch.
# How to Use other packages ?
  - Developers can upload/download their files from some place named ***NPM Registry***
  - Not all packages in the _Registry_ is good. It's an art to find good packages.

# What is Yarn ?
  - ***Yarn*** is a tool that helps us grabbing the required files from _NPM Registry_.

# Three Types of Packages :
  1. Packages you can use on your ***browser*** that help you in ***front-end*** like : "_JQuery_"
  2. Once you can use in ***Backend*** like _Node JS_.
  3. Some commands used in ***Command Line***.
