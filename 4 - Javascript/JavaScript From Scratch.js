====== INTRODUCTION =========
# Javascript doesn't need any professional IDE. All we need is a text editor and a web browser like google chrome or etc.
# JS is a non-typed language which means there is no need to define a type (int , string, ... ) before the variable name.
# JS is also a "dynamic programming language" which means a variable can be defined as a String but later in the code be assigned an integer number ( like python)
# Suggested Text Editors : Atom , VS Code , Sublime Text , Notepad++
# Suggested IDEs : WebStorm , Eclipse , Visual Stduio
