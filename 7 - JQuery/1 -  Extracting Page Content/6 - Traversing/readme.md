## DOM
#### What is the DOM?
The __DOM__ -  ( ___Document Object Model___ ) is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The _DOM_ defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
  - __Core DOM__ : standard model for all document types
  - __XML DOM__ : standard model for XML documents
  - __HTML DOM__ : standard model for HTML documents
#### What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
  - The HTML elements as objects
  - The properties of all HTML elements
  - The methods to access all HTML elements
  - The events for all HTML elements
  - In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.
